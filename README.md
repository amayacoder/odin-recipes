# Project: Recipes

This is a project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP). This is my first project and I am following the [Project: Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes); my first project in the Foundations Course. 

I will be practising using HTML to create the framework of the website and also practising using git to track and commit changes to my project.

Let's see how it goes. 20022025
