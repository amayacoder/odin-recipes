    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3½. Grease and line a 20cm square tin
        with baking parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the flaxseed with 6 tbsp water and set aside for at least 5
        mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a saucepan, melt 120g chocolate, the coffee and margarine with 60ml
        water on a low heat. Allow to cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the flour, almonds, cocoa, baking powder and ¼ tsp salt in a bowl
        and stir to remove any lumps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a hand whisk, mix the sugar into the melted chocolate mixture, and
        beat well until smooth and glossy, ensuring all the sugar is well
        dissolved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the flaxseed mixture, vanilla extract and remaining chocolate,
        then the flour mixture.
      </li>
      <li>Spoon into the prepared tin.</li>
      <li>
        Bake for 35-45 mins until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out
        clean with moist crumbs. Allow to cool in the tin completely, then cut
        into squares.
      </li>
    </ol>
