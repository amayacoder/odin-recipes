      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat the oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3½. Grease and line a 20cm square
          tin with baking parchment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine the flaxseed with 6 tbsp water and set aside for at least 5
          mins.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a saucepan, melt 120g chocolate, the coffee and margarine with 60ml
          water on a low heat. Allow to cool slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put the flour, almonds, cocoa, baking powder and ¼ tsp salt in a bowl
          and stir to remove any lumps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a hand whisk, mix the sugar into the melted chocolate mixture,
          and beat well until smooth and glossy, ensuring all the sugar is well
          dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the flaxseed mixture, vanilla extract and remaining chocolate,
          then the flour mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon into the prepared tin.</li>
        <li>
          Bake for 35-45 mins until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out
          clean with moist crumbs. Allow to cool in the tin completely, then cut
          into squares.
        </li>
